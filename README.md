Inspiration Image/Animation:
Yuru Camp Season1 op: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-EwChG1WTA    0:42-0:43
The Shape:
Night: Nearly at midnight
Starry Star: Different Colors of starry star and sparkle in the sky.
Vega: The vega is stable in the same position and the star trails revolve around it.
Star Trails: Hundreds of white star trails travel around with vega.
Mountain. fog, forest: All of them have silmiliar shape with similiar code.
Moon: The light yellow moon is on the top of the image and it can moved by mouse preesed

Randomness: (By Each Reroll)
--Starry star has random quantities,size, and color.
--Mountain. fog, forest:all of them has different shape
--Moon can move randomly by mouse pressed
--Star Trails: Each of them have random quantities, size, and rotation speed.

Interactivity:(By Click)
--The initial screen shows an impression of the hundreds of star trails. The star trails rotateanimately after user click the image.

Artist Statment:
My first impression of this project was about the animation depicting the environment. 
Because I like Yuru Camp, a Japanese animation with detailed descriptions of the environment, 
that's where my inspiration came from.

My goal for p2 was to recreate the Yulucamp opening-Shiny Days scene as much as possible (see the Inspiration section).
Because I'm still a beginner of p5js, this project has most of the references on starter parts. As for star trails,
I learned how to rotate star trails through video and text tutorials. At first, I was going to imitate the scene of the star trails 
spinning in the opening. But to increase randomness and match my bad taste, I decided to make all the star trails have different 
rotation speeds.

Most of my goals have been achieved, and I have added some of my imagination to this project. However, I'm still struggling with how the star trails can still revolve around the vega when the vega appears in random positions. Due to limited knowledge, I finally gave up on this plan. I hope that in my future studies, I can grasp how two objects can follow each other.
